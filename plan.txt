HTML
1. Create HTML boiler plate, assign css and JS links and add title, heading and a little description.
2. create an unordered list item and in that list we will add list items using JS.
3. create a button to check the order of the list.

JAVASCRIPT
1. declare variables for check-button and unordered draggable list.
2. create an array of names in order of richest people.
3. We create an empty array called listItems in which we will store our list items
4. We will initialize a variable called dragStartIndex which will keep track of index.
5. We will then create a function called CreateList() which will create list items into DOM

Scrambling the names
1. add a map method to an array and create an object with value as the name and sort as a random number.
2. sort the array with sort number from highest to lowest.
3. add a map method again to just retrieve the value of just name.

Drag and Drop API
1. We added addEventListeners() function into our createList() function 
2. we declared variables for all draggables and dragList items
3. we added dragstart event listener on draggables and rest of drag events into lists
4. we will get dragStartIndex from the item we are dragging and dragEndIndex from the item we are dropping and we will swap the indexes

Check order
1. We created an event listener for check button and added a function called check order
2. on check Order function we first got listItem from listItems Array and then gained each of the person's name
3. we matched the person's name with the original array and checked if its true or not.
4. If it not true we added wrong class to list item and if true, we removed wrong class and added right class
